# Email-Threat-Interceptor# Email Threat Interceptor


An advanced, client-side intelligence dashboard for Gmail that provides a final, critical layer of defense against sophisticated phishing and social engineering attacks that bypass traditional server-side filters.

## Overview

In an era where cyber threats are increasingly sophisticated, relying solely on server-side email filters is no longer sufficient. The **Email Threat Interceptor** is a Manifest V3 Chrome Extension that injects a real-time security dashboard directly into the Gmail UI. It acts as a proactive "Heads-Up Display" for the user, providing actionable intelligence at the most critical momentâ€”right before they click a link or trust a sender.

## Core Features

-   **âœ… SPF & DMARC Validation:** Verifies that an email was sent from a server authorized by the domain owner.
-   **ðŸ“… Domain Age Analysis:** Checks the domain's creation date to flag newly created domains, a common tactic for phishing.
-   **ðŸ”— Malicious URL Scanning:** Cross-references every link in the email against VirusTotal's massive database of known threats.
-   **ðŸ¤« Hidden Content Detection:** Performs a local scan to find and flag deceptive links, invisible tracking pixels, and other hidden elements.
